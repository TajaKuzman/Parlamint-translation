# Machine translating the ParlaMint output

Tasks:
- analyse various MT models on a sample data (ParlaMint-sample-sentence-tokenized.txt): see [code in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tajakuz/simple-machine-translation-with-various-mt-systems), results in the spreadsheet *ParlaMint_MT_Comparison-all-models.xlsx*
- extract data to be translated based on the Parlamint format
- use OPUSMT through EasyNMT to machine translate the output
- use eftomal to get word alignments (train it with the MT output) and assure that proper names are correctly translated based on the word alignments

Workflow:
1. Extract information from the CONLL-U
2. Translate
3. Tokenize English translations with Stanza
4. Word alignment, get information on NE annotations for each translated word from the source annotations
5. Linguistically process English translation with Stanza (lemmas, POS, ner)
6. Parse CONLL-u file and add additional information (sentence ids, alignments in both directions, source text, SpaceAfter information)

Workflow (more details):
1. Extract from each sentence in the CONLL-u file:
	- sent_id (in metadata) (# sent_id = ParlaMint-SI_2014-08-01-SDZ7-Redna-01.seg1.1)
	- "text" (in metadata): to be feed into the MT system (# text = Spoštovani, prosim, da zasedete svoja mesta.)
	- tokenized text (punctuation separated from words by space): by iterating through the tokens in the sentence - create a list of tokens and join them into a string (["Spoštovani", "prosim", ",", "da"] -> "Spoštovani prosim , da). In case of multiword tokens, we will add the subword tokens to the tokenized text and skip the multiword token. We will also get all necessary information about the ids and lemmas from the subword tokens. The subword tokens do not have the NER annotation, so we will use the multiword annotation for all of its subparts.
	- list of NE annotations (same length as the tokens) - we want NE annotations for all tokens, with the information on the lemma and index if the NE is not "0": ["O", "O", "O", {4: "PER-I", "Borut"}]
	- information on the proper nouns: if the word is annotated as a proper noun (has "PER" in ner attribute), take its index, form and lemma and save it into a dictionary for each sentence ({0: (Taje, Taja), 1: (Kuzman, Kuzman)})
2. Translate
3. Word alignment:
	- We apply the stanza tokenization over the translation; use tokenize_no_ssplit to avoid splitting sentences in multiple sentences. Save also information on whether there was initially a space around punctuation (based on start_char and end_char information) which we use at the end to remove spaces around the punctuation in the translation.
	- Perform word alignment.
	- Save forward and reverse alignment information for each sentence (2 additional columns).
	- Substitute translated NE words with lemmas based on the annotation, save new translation to a new column.
4. Linguistic processing of translated text:
	- We use Stanza to get POS, lemmas and NER (the 4 tag package: conll03). Send in the "pre-tokenized text" (created in previous steps).
	- Transform the result into CONLL-u (which should contain tokens, lemmas, pos). Parse the CONLL-u file and add:
		1) sentence_id as metadata
		2) forward and reverse alignment as metadata (# align_s = 1-1 2-2... and #align_t = 1-1 2-2...),
		3) based on alignment, add SpaceAfter information - I add this information only if "SpaceAfter" is "No" (as it is in the original texts)
		4) source text ("source")
		5) improved translated text (#text metadata): based on SpaceAfter information, remove spaces around punctuation
		6) Delete startchar and endchar information from ["misc"] metadata element
		7) Change the NER tags so that they correspond to the source NER tags: "S-" to "B-", "E-" to "I-"
	- Save the file as CONLLU with the same name as the source CONLLU file (so each file will be saved separately). The number of sentences should be the same as in the source CONLLU and ANA file.

This is now implemented, the sample file is in "results/CZ/final_translated_conllu/ParlaMint-CZ_2013-12-04-ps2013-002-01-003-003.conllu"

Some remarks:
- Stanza does not output "SpaceAfter" information, I added it manually based on the start_char and end_char information

**Questions:**
- I've checked for all corpora which OPUS-MT models we can use. There exist more or less specific models for all except Hungarian, for which we can use multilingual model. The main problem is Norwegian, which is not stated under multilingual or any other model. This language is covered by eTranslation and Google Translate, should we use one of those, or just the multilingual model?

Workflow (Nikola's description):
- we extract the sequence of tokens of each sentence with the corresponding NE annotations and lemmas of PERS Nes, we merge the tokens and translate the sentence. We disregard any XLM elements inside the sentence.
- we apply the stanza tokenization over the translation (if multiple sentences come out, we merge the tokens back into one sentence) - we just need a list of tokens; use tokenize_no_ssplit da se izogneš razdeljevanju na stavke. Then for applying stanza for POS, we will send in the "pre-tokenized text"
- we perform word alignment, we transfer the NE annotations to the translated sentence, we transfer the PERS NE lemmas to the translation
- we apply POS and LEMMA processors over the data. The conllu is to contain (tokenize, pos, lemma), the conllu is to be have the PERS lemmas transferred, all NE annotations are to be transferred as annotations as well (MISC column).
- for each original ana file, we release a conllu file with the same name and with the number of sentences equal to the number of sentences in the ana file, each conllu sentence is to have the original sentence ID
- word alignment in both directions is to be shared as a metadatum in each sentence header (# align_s = 1-1 2-2... and #align_t = 1-1 2-2...)
- metadata translation: **we want to translate all the text contents of non-s elements - does this include the gap elements; can I get a list of all elements somewhere?**, but in a lexicon-based approach, so extracting all "Ploskanje" etc., deduplicating, translating, and **returning as a tab-separated dataset - what should the dataset include - source, translation, maybe also tag name, anything else?**, to be applied in the translated resource by Tomaž and Matyaš. **Should I perform word alignment on it as well?**



## Sample analysis

I've created a sample of 40 files from the ParlaMint-SI. The sample has 115,993 sentences and 2,496,942 words. It represents roughly 10% of the entire ParlaMint-SI.

Translation took app. 1 hour and alignment took 5 minutes.

In the sample, around 10% of sentences (10,472) consist of proper names. Out of them, in 6039 sentences, at least one proper name was substituted - this means that substitution occurred in 58 % of all sentences with proper nouns, and in 5% of all sentences in the sample.

I analysed the most common substitutions (substitutions that occurred more than 20 times) which represent 30% of all substitutions. Out of all instances of these substitutions, 87% are correct. Incorrect substitutions are connected with wrong NER: "Slovenians", "Slovenec", "Christmas", "Ombudsman" were annotated as proper names.

Most common substitutions:

|                                                          |   substituted_words (word in translation, corrected word) |

### Errors in the substitution process

There were 42 errors (0.4% of sentences with proper nouns) which prevented substitution. Reasons for errors:
- in the machine translation, the proper name was omitted (66% of errors) - inspection of results showed that the MT model is very prone to omitting parts of sentences
- some pairs of sentences (especially quotes) were annotated and tokenized as being one sentence, which led to wrong NER (18% of errors) - words with which the quotes began, were annotated as a proper name (see instances below). This also led to null alignment, because they were not found in the translation.
- null alignments (16% of errors) - some translations differ from the original words so much that eflomal did not align the word to anything

Examples of omission of the proper name:

|       | text                                                                                                                                                                                 | new_translations                                                                                                                                                                 | alignments                                                                                                                                                                                                              | errors                                         |
